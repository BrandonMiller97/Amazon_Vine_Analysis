### 3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

- 60% of all reviews were given a 5-star rating.  All (100%) of 5-star reviews were given by unpaid Vine users.

## Summary: 
---
There is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program given the fact that all 5-star reviews were given by unpaid users.
