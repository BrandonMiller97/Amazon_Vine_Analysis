## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the vine program.  Specifically, we looked to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews

## Results:

- After filtering the vine table to identify the reviews where the percent of helpful votes was not less than 50% of the reviews with greater than 19 votes, there was a total of 403,807 reviews (Vine and non-Vine)

### 3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

- 60% of all reviews were given a 5-star rating.  All (100%) of 5-star reviews were given by unpaid Vine users.

## Summary: 
---
There is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program given the fact that all 5-star reviews were given by unpaid users.
